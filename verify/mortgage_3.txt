LAS VEGAS -- Two men were arrested Friday on new charges in connection with operating a scam intended to steal mortgage payments from homeowners.
Joseph Yorkus, 49, and James Bartczak, 48, were arrested Feb. 3 after setting up Great Western Business Services, which sent letters to homeowners claiming their mortgage loans were no longer being serviced by Bank of America and were now being serviced by Great Western.
The letters then directed homeowners to send their mortgage payments to Great Western. Numerous homeowners missed their mortgage payments as a result of the scam, Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto said.
The new charges stem from three other fraudulent businesses Yorkus and Bartczak were running, Cortez Masto said.
The businesses were identified as BAC Collections, Fresh Start Consultants and Learn Your Rights. The businesses would try to get homeowners to send their mortgage payments to the businesses.
The businesses would also promise to help homeowners in repairing their credit and modifying their home loans, including principal reduction.
One of Yorkus and Bartczak's victims is a senior citizen who lost $10,000 based on the men's false promises, Cortez Masto said.
"This case is another example of the type of organized, systematic fraud that is rampant in the mortgage and foreclosure rescue businesses," she said. "My Mortgage Fraud Strike Force is dedicating all its resources to investigating and aggressively prosecuting these kinds of scams." said Attorney General Masto.
The Attorney General urges those who have been involved in this or other mortgage fraud scam to call 702-486-3132.
