Simple NaiveBayes inspired document classifier

Files in data folder define different topics - filename is the name of the topic and content is topic sample
The sample for each topic is based on wikipedia entries (first paragraph mostly) for relevant entries

Files in verify folder represent test documents, with each file name including the name of assumed topic.

Running 'run_against_verification.rb' will init the classifier with sample data, and then test vs. all files in verify.
Tested with Ruby 1.9.2 - no idea if it works in any other version

No text processing is applied - no stemming, NLP or even a downcase.
